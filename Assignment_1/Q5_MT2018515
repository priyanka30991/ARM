We can give an input to a hardware board through GPIO pins. It will generate an interrupt. This will be handled by an Interrupt Handler. 
The processor will tak the input and then it will again return to the main program. A GPIO (general purpose input/output) pin lets you 
either get input for your program from outside the CPU or to provide output to the user.
