Ques 4 - Can we do nested IF-Then else in CORTEX â€“M4?  

Ans - No, we can't do nested IF-Then Else. Because, as per the ARM assembly ITE means if then else. 
The number of T and E specify the number of times then and else can exist. 
For example ITE will mean 1 then and 1 else. 
For nested if, it needs to be put inside another if as per the rule, we can have only one then here. 
Hence, we can't used nested If-Then-Else
